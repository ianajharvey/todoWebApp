# To-Do Web App

A simple and interactive To-Do List web application built using **Python** and **Streamlit**. Users can add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them â€” all in a clean and responsive UI.
Built as part of a learning course

## Features

- Add new tasks via a text input
- Remove completed tasks from the list
- Tasks persist between sessions using file storage
- Instant updates using Streamlit's reactivity
